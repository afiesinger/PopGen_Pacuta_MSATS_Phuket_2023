# PopGen_Pacuta_MSATS_Phuket_2023

Raw microsatellite marker sequence and allele reports for a population genetic study using six microsatellite markers for nine Pocillopora acuta populations around Phuket Island, Thailand.

Data corresponding to the article "Population genetic differentiation of the ubiquitous brooding coral Pocillopora acuta along Phuket Island reefs in the Andaman Sea, Thailand" submitted to BMC Ecology and Evolution.

Multiplex Panels for all microsatellite markers correspond to Multiplex PCRs and sequencing runs as indicated in Table 2 of the manuscript.

File:
MSAT_Allele_Reports_complete

File contains all raw allele reports obtained after allele calling in GeneMarker v1.91 (SoftGenetics), flagged alleles that did not correspond to nucleotide repeats for each microsatellite marker, the imputed dataset for missing alleles obtained from MicroDrop (Wang et al., 2012) as well as datasheets in the format for R and the Bayesian clustering analysis STRUCTURE (Pritchard et al., 2000).
